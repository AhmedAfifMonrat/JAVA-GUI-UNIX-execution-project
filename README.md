# JAVA-GUI-UNIX-execution-project
The application should be capable of executing the following Unix commands (or their counterparts in Windows):
1. ls, pwd, uptime, cat file.txt, who, ps, grep, ifconfig
2. It should be possible to pipeline command. For example, this command cd /home/ && pwd | ls â€“al
Which should return a detailed list of files and directories under /home/ folder.
3. Now write another Java class, which will execute a Fibonacci Series. The program should take the number of Sequence as an input parameter, print the sequence in the output field. Launch this program from the GUI! The GUI and the command execution must be implemented in separate classes. Use threads to implement the command execution.
